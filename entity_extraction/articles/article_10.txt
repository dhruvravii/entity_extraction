NEW DELHI: IndiGo on Wednesday became the first Indian airline â and only one so far â whose market capitalisation touched the Rs 1 lakh crore mark. The low cost carrierâs share closed at Rs 2,619.85 (up 3.5%) on BSE Wednesday, taking its market cap to Rs 1.01 lakh crore. Currently operating about 310 aircraft and enjoying over 60% domestic market share, Rahul Bhatia-founded IndiGo has since 2005 placed orders for 1,330 Airbus A320 family planes and is scheduled to receive the remaining 980 of them by 2035. Its order for 500 planes worth $50 billion at list price last week was the single largest order by any airline globally ever.CAPA India CEO & director Kapil Kaul said: âIndiGoâs market cap crossing Rs 1 trillion is an exceptional achievement and a historic milestone that should be celebrated by the entire industry. The carrier has not only delivered a high-quality service to consumers, but it is the only airline in India that has consistently delivered value to shareholders.âThe market cap of other listed airlines on Wednesday included SpiceJet at Rs 1,646 crore and Jet Airways â which stopped flying in 2019 and the planned revival did not take off â at Rs 552 crore. Tata Group airlines, including Air India and Vistara, are not listed.
